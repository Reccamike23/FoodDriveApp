# FoodDriveApp
Food Drive application

Objective: The Food Drive Innovation Project aims to streamline and modernize the process of organizing and conducting food drives for communities in need.

Our Goal in this Project:

Our project aims to enhance and optimize food drives by implementing an efficient and streamlined data collection system. We integrate QR/barcode technology to monitor the number of collected bags seamlessly. This data is then utilized in a web application for predictive analysis, estimating the potential number of bags that can be collected from any stake. Additionally, our application offers a map generation feature, automating the creation of route-specific maps. This comprehensive solution ensures a more effective and data-driven approach to food drive management.

To further enhance our model's accuracy, continuous data feeding with the information gathered over time will be invaluable. This ongoing update will empower the model to provide increasingly precise predictions. Additionally, we plan to refine our route maps by incorporating actual neighborhood names, adding a layer of specificity to our mapping feature. As part of our commitment to user satisfaction, we aim to regularly update the application, introducing new features and optimizing existing ones based on user feedback. This approach ensures that our application remains user-friendly and aligned with evolving needs.
